XPath = xml path language
XPath uses path expressions to select nodes in an XML document
We can also use XPath to select elements from HTML pages.

Syntax of XPath
------------------ 
//tagName - pick a matched node(tag) that is located at any level within the XML document
//tagName[1] - if more than two tag in the XML file, then select node based on its position (one-indexing)
//tagName[@AttributeName="Value"] - picked a matched node where attribute name = "Value"
/tagName - pick a matched node(tag) that is located in current level

Functions of XPath
-------------------
contains()  for example //tagName[contains(@AttributeName, "Value")]
starts-with() 

Operator of XPath
------------------
and   for example //tagName[(expression 1) and (expression 2)]
or    for example //tagName[(@AttributeName="Value") or (@AttributeName="Value2") ]

To get text of node
--------------------
add //text() or /text() at the end of XPath for example //h1/text()
